In this implementation I included the the camera code as a part of the GameObject class, and declared the cameraRect (an SDL_Rect object) global.
the cameraRect is then passed to all update and render functions.

cameraRect.x and cameraRect.y hold the screen's center position values with respect to the player-character's(PC) position.
these values are then subtracted from the actual coordinate position of the PC/tile so as to render visible area.
